  Timothy Pew (aka, "Me") was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up
  programming in Visual Basic, which was not very cool. He didn't like OOP very
  much, but couldn't put his finger on quite why he didn't want to pursue
  programming in a serious capacity.
</p>
<p>
  After many, many years hacking away on little programs to help him do
  non-programming work, including a decade spent
  <a href="https://mrlasers.com">making ebooks</a>. One day, he stumbled his way
  into functional programming and, having been to the mountaintop, wished never
  to return.
</p>
<p>But he'll probably never stop making ebooks as long as someone is asking.</p>
