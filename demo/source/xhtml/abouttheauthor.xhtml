  Timothy Pew (aka, "Me") was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up
  programming in Visual Basic, which was not very cool. He didn't like OOP very
  much, but couldn't put his finger on quite why he didn't want to pursue
  programming in a serious capacity.
</p>
<p>
  After many, many years hacking away on little programs to help him do
  non-programming work, including a decade spent
  <a href="https://mrlasers.com">making ebooks</a>, he stumbled upon functional
  programming. Having been to the mountaintop, he realized that he could never
  go back as there was nothing more fun that he could do with his brain.
</p>
<p>But he'll probably never stop making ebooks as long as someone is asking.</p>
